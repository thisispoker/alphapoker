# alphapoker
Inspired by AlphaGo, so I decide develop one frame work for the no-limited holdem AI robot, which shall be simple and easy 
compared to openholdem, but it is not related to any deep learning.. just for fun that it is named with Alpha
Some of the code comes from the PokerPirate code, which is more friendly to mtt in poker.
This project is more pratical if you really want to make money in real
online cash poker.
